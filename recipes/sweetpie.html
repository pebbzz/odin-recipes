        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Homemade Deluxe Buttery Pie Crust</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes or slices</li>
            <li>2 lb. sweet potatoes washed & dried, equals about 2 cups pureed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ginger</li>
            <li>tiny pinch clove, optional</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons orange or pineapple juice, I use a mixture of both</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 F.</li>
            <li>Pierce sweet potatoes with a fork several times.</li>
            <li>Place on foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45 minutes or until very tender.</li>
            <li>Let cool while preparing the brown butter.</li>
            <li>To make the brown butter, add butter to a heavy-bottom skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted it will begin to foam a bit, whisk continuously while scraping the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>The butter will begin to turn golden and form golden brown bits on the bottom of the pan, keep whisking.</li>
            <li>Once the aromas become nutty (almost like the smell of caramel) and the solids in the bottom of the pan are golden brown remove from heat. </li>
            <li>Pour into a glass dish (including the brown solids) and set aside to let cool.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, scoop out the flesh of the cooled sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>Mix until creamy and smooth, adding a few splashes of water(or milk) until you have the texture of a very thick puree. (don't get it too watery, just use enough water to make mixing easier)</li>
            <li>Mix in the cooled brown butter until smooth.</li>
            <li>Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, evaporated milk, eggs (see note before adding), vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove (if using), juice, and flour until well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour into pie crust shell and smooth the top.</li>
            <li>Preheated oven 350 F. and bake for 55 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool completely until the middle is firmly set.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate until ready to serve. (You can absolutely serve it warm, but I like for it to sit in the fridge for a few hours for a denser, creamier texture.)</li>
            <li>Serve with sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
        </ol>
