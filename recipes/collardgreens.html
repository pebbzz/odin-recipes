        <h3><em>Steps</em></h3>
        <h5>Prep The Collard Greens</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the collard greens bath by filling your kitchen sink with cool water and adding vinegar and salt.</li>
            <li>Remove the collard greens from the steams by folding them in half lengthwise and pulling the leaf away from the stem. (discard the stem or see note below on how to cook them)</li>
            <li>Place the collard greens into the prepared water bath and swish them around several times, scrubbing them to help loosen up any dirt.</li>
            <li>Let the collard greens soak for 15-20 minutes, giving them a scrub midway. Drain the water and refill with plain water and allow the greens to soak again if needed. Repeat as many times as needed until the water is free from any dirt or grit. After the final soak, drain the water. Next, rinse and scrub each leaf front and back with cool water to ensure they are squeaky clean.
            </li>
            <li>Tear the greens into bite-sized pieces and set them aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Cook The Greens</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil. Add onions and saute until tender.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Pour in the broth and add the turkey leg. Bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Add collard greens and reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook collard for 1 hour (or longer depending on your desired tenderness), stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Once done, stir and then taste the broth and the greens. (add a little water if the broth is too bold for your liking)</li>
            <li>Stir in vinegar and smoked salt, and black pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve collard greens with pieces of the smoked turkey leg and hot sauce if desired.</li>
            
        </ol>
